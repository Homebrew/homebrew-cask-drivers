# How to Contribute

All of the [instructions for contributing from the main repository](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) apply, and won't be repeated here. You simply need to change references to `caskroom/homebrew-cask` (that repository) to `caskroom/homebrew-drivers` (this repository).


## Naming Driver Casks

All Cask names and tokens should be of the form `<vendor>-<token>`.

### Driver Token Examples

Cask Token          | `<vendor>-<token>`    | Filename
--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------
`logic`             | `saleae-logic`        | `saleae-logic.rb`
`razer-synapse`     | `razer-synapse`       | `razer-synapse.rb`
